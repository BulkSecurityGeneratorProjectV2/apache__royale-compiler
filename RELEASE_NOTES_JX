Apache Flex 'FalconJX' Cross-Compiler 0.7.0
=================

Apache Flex 'FalconJX' Compiler 0.7.0 is the fifth release of a next-generation
compiler that, instead of creating a SWF or SWC, cross compiles MXML and ActionScript

This release includes Maven artifacts.

The ability to use source maps to see your ActionScript source in the browser debugger is introduced in this release.  The implementation is likely to have bugs.

In addition, lots of bug fixes and small improvements are included in this release.

Apache Flex 'FalconJX' Cross-Compiler 0.5.0
=================

Apache Flex 'FalconJX' Compiler 0.5.0 is the third release of a next-generation
compiler that, instead of creating a SWF or SWC, cross compiles MXML and ActionScript
to JavaScript.  It is intended for use as the cross-compiler for Apache FlexJS SDKs.  

Highlights in this release include:
- ExternC compiler that generates ActionScript SWCs from Google Closure Library
Externs for Common Libraries.  This enables the use of ActionScript to write
JavaScript for native JavaScript applications.
- Integration with IntelliJ.  You can now use Falcon and FalconJX in IntelliJ.  See
the wiki for instructions: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLEX/Using+FlexJS+with+IntelliJ+IDEA

Apache Flex 'FalconJX' Compiler 0.0.2 is the second release of a next-generation
compiler that, instead of creating a SWF or SWC, cross compiles MXML and ActionScript
to JavaScript.  It is intended for use as the cross-compiler for Apache FlexJS SDKs.  

The only major change in this release is to speed up cross-compilation by only copying a subset of the Google Closure Library files to the output folder.

Bug Fixes
---------
-FLEX-34258 Error cross-compiling on Windows
-FLEX-34225 Configurations dependent on loading order of methods

Apache Flex 'FalconJX' Cross-Compiler 0.0.1

to JavaScript.  It is intended for use as the cross-compiler for Apache FlexJS SDKs.  
It is an extension of the Apache Flex 'Falcon' Compiler. 

Bug Fixes
---------
-FLEX-34224 An option to specifiy the output folder is missing

Known Issues
_____________

Unimplemented Compiler Features

The FlexJS SDK does not support embedding of assets or fonts and the compiler may
not handle embedding correctly and may even throw errors.

Flex SDK is not supported.

The FalconJX cross-compiler only supports compilation against a FlexJS SDK, not the Apache Flex SDK.

Command-line Usage

The FalconJX cross-compiler supports multiple output types.  They are specified to mxmlc and compc scripts and batch files via the options -js-output-type.  Only -js-output-type=FLEXJS is supported.

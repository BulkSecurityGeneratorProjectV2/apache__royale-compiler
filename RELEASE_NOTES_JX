Unimplemented Compiler Features

The FlexJS SDK does not support embedding of assets or fonts and the compiler may
not handle embedding correctly and may even throw errors.

Flex SDK is not supported.

The FalconJX cross-compiler only supports compilation against a FlexJS SDK, not the Apache Flex SDK.

Command-line Usage

The FalconJX cross-compiler supports multiple output types.  They are specified to mxmlc and compc scripts and batch files via the options -js-output-type.  Only -js-output-type=FLEXJS is supported.

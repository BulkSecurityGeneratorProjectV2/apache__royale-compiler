Apache FalconJS Compiler
====================

Before trying to build FalconJS, you must:

1. Build Falcon (the compiler folder).  Follow instructions in the parent folder's README

2. Try to compile tests/TestApp.  It should generate .js files for TestApp.as and MainCode.as

To run FalconJS, use the bin/mxmlc script.  Pass in the .as file of the top-level application like you would normally pass it in to mxmlc with all of the same options.

Example for running FalconJS : ../bin/mxmlc TestApp.as -output TestApp.js

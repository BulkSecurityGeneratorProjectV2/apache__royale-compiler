Apache Flex Compiler
====================

Before trying to build Falcon, you must:

1. Build the the "develop" branch of the SDK at incubator/flex/sdk/branches/develop by doing 'ant main'.
See the README there for instructions.

2. Set the environment variables JAVA_HOME, ANT_HOME, PLAYERGLOBAL_HOME, and FLASHPLAYER_DEBUGGER as when building the SDK.

3. Set the environment variable JFLEX_JAR to point to the JAR file for JFlex 1.4.3.

Before running unit-, functional- or feature-tests you need to create a unittest.properties file ( template is found here compiler.tests/template-unittest.properties ).

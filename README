Apache Flex Compiler
====================

Before trying to build Falcon, you must:

1. Build the the "develop" branch of the SDK at incubator/flex/sdk/branches/develop by doing 'ant main'.
See the README there for instructions.

2. Set the environment variables JAVA_HOME, ANT_HOME, and PLAYERGLOBAL_HOME as when building the SDK.

3. Set the environment variable JFLEX_JAR to point to the JAR file for JFlex 1.4.3.

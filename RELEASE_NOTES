Apache Flex 'Falcon' Compiler 0.0.1
=================

Apache Flex 'Falcon' Compiler 0.0.1 is the initial release of a next-generation
compiler intended to someday replace the MXMLC in Apache Flex SDKs, and is the
compiler for Apache FlexJS SDKs.  It is based on the Adobe ASC2.0 compiler but
officially supports MXML compilation and includes some bug fixes. 

Known Issues
_____________

Adobe Flash Builder Integration

The Apache Flex Falcon compiler should work in Adobe Flash Builder 4.7, but does
not support incremental compilation and may compile the project even if nothing
has changed.

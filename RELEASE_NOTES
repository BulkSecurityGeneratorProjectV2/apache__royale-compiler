Apache Royale Compiler 0.9.0

compiler for building Apache Royale applications.

The compiler was previously released by the Apache Flex project.  You can
see RELEASE_NOTES for earlier releases in the Apache Flex releases.

Known Issues
_____________

Adobe Flash Builder Integration

The Apache Royale Compiler can be used in Adobe Flash Builder 4.7, but does
not support incremental compilation or clean non-SWF output.


Unit Test results in compiler.tests 

The jar.tests report "Java Result: 1" which is expected as all these tests do is verify that the jar is executable and has a "main" entry point which in this case reports the compiler usage help and returns 1.

Compilation Warnings

The Java compiler will report warnings for several files in this release.
